# Next.js 15 Routing Bug

This repository demonstrates an intermittent routing issue encountered in Next.js 15 when using both the `next/link` component and the `useRouter` hook for navigation between pages.  The issue manifests as unexpected behavior, such as the page not updating correctly or a blank screen being displayed.  The bug is intermittent and does not occur consistently.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate between the Home and About pages repeatedly. You may need to try several times to see the unexpected behavior.

## Potential Causes

* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Asynchronous operations within the routing process could lead to race conditions or unexpected states.
* **State Management:** Issues with state management or component lifecycle methods may be contributing to the problem.
* **Next.js Internal Changes:** Changes in Next.js 15's routing implementation could potentially cause unexpected interactions between `Link` and `useRouter`.

## Solution

A potential solution, included in `bugSolution.js`, involves using only either `next/link` or `useRouter` consistently to avoid potential conflicts between the two.  For more complex navigation scenarios, explore using a dedicated routing library that provides more robust error handling and control.
